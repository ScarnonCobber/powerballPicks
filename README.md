   Program to choose powerball numbers; 8 numbers between 1 and 45.

   Aims to maximize winnings by not sharing any wins with other players. As people often choose
   last weeks numbers or birthdates, the program asks the user to enter last weeks numbers and
   generates random numbers excluding previous weeks and numbers under 12 (only using birth months
   so as to leave reasonable amount of remaining options, but otherwise could be number under 31).
