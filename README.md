Program to choose powerball/lotto numbers; 8 numbers between 1 and 45.
Aims to maximize winnings by not sharing any wins with other players. As people often choose
last weeks numbers or birthdates, the program asks the user to enter game info (range of numbers,
and how many numbers selceted) and last weeks numbers and
generates random numbers excluding previous weeks and birthdates. (numbners less than 31)
